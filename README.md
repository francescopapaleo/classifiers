# Audio Machine Learning

This repository contains various materials on audio machine learning.
It's a work in progress, so there might be some errors and missing information.
The materials are organized in folders, each one containing notebooks and/or scripts.


## Fundamentals

The folder [fundamentals](./fundamentals) contains notebooks to learn the basics of machine learning and audio signal processing.


## Notebooks

The folder [notebooks](./notebooks) contains some examples of machine learning algorithms applied to audio data. 

[1. Classification: Logistic Regression, SVM and MLP](./notebooks/01-logistic_regression_SVM_MLP.ipynb)

[2. Train a classifier with scikit-learn](./notebooks/02-classifier_scikit_learn.ipynb)

[3. Keras Sequential Model](./notebooks/03-keras_sequential_model.ipynb)

[4. Feature Extraction and Classification on Guitarset](./notebooks/04-guitarset_feature_extraction_classification.ipynb)
